# honey-route
 HoneyRoute serves smallholder beekeepers and cooperative administrators. It provides photo-based pest/disease detection (e.g., Varroa risk), alerting, recommendations, action logging, and basic mapping. Future phases include floral resource maps and predictive risk zones. The system will be branded as “HoneyRoute — Powered by EcoVentus.”
